				An article (abbreviated art) is a word (or prefix or suffix) that is used with a noun to indicate 
				the type of reference being made by the noun. Articles specify grammatical definiteness of the noun,
				 in some languages extending to volume or numerical scope. 
				The articles in the English language are the and a/an, and (in certain contexts) some. 'An' and 'a'
				 are modern forms of the Old English 'an', which in Anglian dialects was the number 'one' (compare 
				 'on', in Saxon dialects) and survived into Modern Scots as the number 'owan'. Both 'on' (respelled 'one'
				  by the Normans) and 'an' survived into Modern English, with 'one' used as the number and 'an' ('a', before
				   nouns that begin with a consonant sound) as an indefinite article.In many languages, articles are a special
				    part of speech, which cannot easily be combined with other parts of speech. In English, articles are 
				    frequently considered a part of a broader speech category called determiners, which combines articles and 
				    demonstratives (such as 'this' and 'that').
